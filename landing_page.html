          <p>My name is De'Aisha Lougin. I am a Sophomore at <span>Mississippi State University</span> who once was
            a <span>psychology major</span>, but now has trespassed into the amazing world of being a <span>Computer Science major</span>.
            I was inspired to make this project based on a social media post on the app Tiktok, that
            presented a submission form for people to share their similar experiences in life.
            At the moment, I am currently focusing it on being a place where i can upload about my life and
            all the things I struggle with, but also succeed at at the same time. Given more time and experience,
            I hope to make this into a platform other women and people can do the same.

            The reason I chose Computer Science all started with one summer. The last summer
            was one of the most conflicting summers I have ever had academic wise. I started off with
            Psychology, but knew even during the previous school year that Psychology and my original
            plan of becoming a Therapist was not the life/career route for me. I did not believe it 
            was a life style cut out for me, not that i did not want to help people, but more so that
            i wanted to be helpful in a more interesting and interactive/technological way. I started with UX Research
            later also realizing research was not my <span><i>perogative</i></span>. Then came <span>Web Development</span>.

            Ever since I was in 9th grade. Kdramas have been apart of my life and experiences growing up.
            They have given me the opportunity to experience emotions i have never felt before,
            cry my heart out, laugn endlessly, and even meet the most amazing people I have ever known
            through them liking kdramas as well.

            Programming has been one of the hardest challenges I have ever given myself. It started with
            a small peaked interest of finding html and css interesting during my previous school year. To building
            social media clones, feeling rewarded by the immediate output i received from my effort/work to making the 
            actual decision to change my major, which has been hard, but not regretful at all.

            Studying can be difficult at times. It can be exhausting to the point of being on the brink of tears.
            As i have aged and grew from academic validation, I have learned the study methods that are best for me, the 
            comfort i need from myself or others if i don't meet my expectations, and even the freeing reality of 
            at times not putting restrictive expectation on myself that i would need to meet.

          <p>
            Dancing has always been freeing. I could remember the time i would dance late at night when i 
            was troubled and feeling a release of the stress. Dancing has and will always be an outlet for me, and 
            I'm grateful for the opportunities I have had to do it.
