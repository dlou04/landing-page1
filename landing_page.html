          <p>My name is De'Aisha Lougin. I am a Sophomore at <span>Mississippi State University</span> who once was
            a <span>psychology major</span>, but now has trespassed into the amazing world of being a <span>Computer Science major</span>.
            I was inspired to make this project based on a social media post on the app Tiktok, that
            presented a submission form for people to share their similar experiences in life.
            At the moment, I am currently focusing it on being a place where i can upload about my life and
            all the things I struggle with, but also succeed at at the same time. Given more time and experience,
            I hope to make this into a platform other women and people can do the same.

            The reason I chose Computer Science all started with one summer. The last summer
            was one of the most conflicting summers I have ever had academic wise. I started off with
            Psychology, but knew even during the previous school year that Psychology and my original
            plan of becoming a Therapist was not the life/career route for me. I did not believe it 
            was a life style cut out for me, not that i did not want to help people, but more so that
            i wanted to be helpful in a more interesting and interactive/technological way. I started with UX Research
            later also realizing research was not my <span><i>perogative</i></span>. Then came <span>Web Development</span>.
